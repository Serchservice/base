***Cheers to a new beginning!*** As the world continues to evolve, technology has become an integral part of our daily lives. From online shopping to remote work, we are constantly looking for ways to make our lives easier and more efficient. And that's where Serch comes in - the platform that makes requesting and providing services easier than ever before. Serch is here to revolutionize the way we request and provide services. With its user-friendly platform, Serch makes it easy for users to connect with reliable service providers at any time and from anywhere.

Serch is a new service platform designed to connect users with service providers in a simple and seamless way. With Serch, you can request services from our select services (mechanics, electricians and plumbers), with just a few taps on your phone. The platform offers a range of features such as video calling, chat, and Connect-To-Go (CTG), which allows users to know when a particular user is on a service trip with a particular provider.

**Connect-To-Go (CTG)** is a feature that allows users to signal that they are on a service trip with a particular service provider. This feature is useful in ensuring the safety and security of both the user and the service provider.

At Serch, we understand that finding reliable service providers can be a daunting task. That's why we have created a platform that not only makes it easy to find the right service provider but also ensures that you get the best possible service. Whether you're a user or a service provider, Serch has got you covered. For users, our platform offers features such as RequestSharing, Tip2Fix, and Promo Codes, which help users to save time, money and provide a better user experience.

Serch also provides service providers with the opportunity to invite other providers to join them on a service trip, with the ability to share the fee earned. This feature is known as **RequestSharing**. Serch also offers various subscription plans to users and providers, such as the free trial plan which has a 14-day duration, the Serch all-day plan which has certain limitations, and the Serch premium plan which provides unlimited access to the platform.

For service providers, Serch offers features such as Free Trial, Serch All Day Plan, and Serch Premium, which help service providers to grow their business, increase their visibility and provide better service to users. At Serch, we are committed to providing a safe and secure platform for all our users. We have implemented strict safety protocols and guidelines to ensure that all transactions on the platform are safe and secure.

Users can also enjoy the benefits of promo codes which they can apply to their transactions to enjoy discounts and other benefits. With Serch, users can be assured of safe and reliable service requests and service provision. The platform is constantly improving and expanding its services, and is committed to providing a seamless and stress-free experience for users and service providers alike.

In conclusion, the launch of Serch marks a new beginning in the world of service requests and provision. With its innovative features, user-friendly platform and commitment to safety and reliability, Serch is set to change the game and revolutionize the industry. ***So cheers to Serch, and to a new beginning!***
