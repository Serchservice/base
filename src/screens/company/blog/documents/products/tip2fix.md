With the introduction of the Tip2Fix (T2F) feature, Serch aims at providing both users/clients and service providers/artisans, several options toward requesting and providing, respectively.

Serch is a platform that connects users with skilled service providers for mechanical, electrical, and plumbing needs. One of the unique features of Serch is Tip2Fix, which allows a user to go on a service guide with a provider using a video call feature. In this blog, we will explore all you should know about Tip2Fix and how it benefits both users and providers.

How it Works:
If a user needs help fixing a problem, they can use the Tip2Fix feature on the user app. They can select the relevant skill (Mechanic, Electrician, or Plumber), and then select the Tip2Fix feature.

After selecting the feature, the user is connected with a skilled service provider who will guide them through fixing the problem via a video call feature. The provider will provide step-by-step instructions on how to fix the problem, and the user can follow along and ask questions in real-time.

Once the service guide is complete, Serch pays the provider a certain amount of money, which is deducted from the user's wallet. The Tip2Fix feature removes the need for the user to come over to get the problem fixed, and helps users learn how to fix a problem while just paying a cheap amount of money.

Benefits for Users:
The Tip2Fix feature benefits users in several ways. Firstly, it provides an opportunity for users to learn how to fix problems themselves, which can save them money in the long run. Instead of having to call a service provider every time something breaks, users can use Tip2Fix to learn how to fix the problem themselves.

Secondly, it removes the need for users to physically be present with the provider, which can save them time and money on transportation costs. With Tip2Fix, users can get the help they need without leaving their homes, making it a convenient and efficient way to fix problems.

Benefits for Providers:
Tip2Fix also benefits providers by expanding their reach and visibility. By offering service guides via video call, providers can reach users who may not have been able to hire them otherwise. This can lead to more opportunities for providers to earn and grow their business.

In addition, it provides an opportunity for providers to showcase their expertise and build their reputation. By providing quality service guides to users, they can receive positive feedback and ratings, which can attract more users to engage their services.

Conclusion:
Tip2Fix is a unique and innovative feature offered by Serch. It allows users to learn how to fix problems themselves, removes the need for physical presence, and expands the reach and visibility of providers. By using this feature, users can save money and time, and providers can earn and grow their business. Overall, Tip2Fix is a win-win for everyone involved and is just one of the many reasons why Serch is a great platform for finding skilled service providers.

When it comes to fixing mechanical, electrical, and plumbing issues, finding the right service provider can be a hassle. However, Serch is a platform that aims to make this process easier and more convenient. One of the features that make Serch stand out from other platforms is Tip2Fix (T2F). In this blog, we will explore all you need to know about T2F and how it can benefit users.

What is Tip2Fix?
Tip2Fix is a feature on the Serch platform that allows a user to go on a service guide with a provider using a video call feature. The T2F feature provides an alternative to the traditional way of fixing a problem, which is usually done by a service provider physically visiting the user's location.

With T2F, users can request a service guide from a skilled service provider, and the provider will guide them on how to fix the problem remotely via a video call. After the service guide, Serch pays the provider a certain amount of money, which is deducted from the user's wallet. This removes the need for the provider to come over physically, which saves time and money for both the user and the provider.

Benefits of T2F:
The T2F feature offers several benefits to both users and providers. Firstly, it provides users with an opportunity to learn how to fix a problem themselves, saving them time and money in the long run. By learning from skilled providers, users can acquire the knowledge needed to solve similar issues in the future.

Secondly, it benefits providers by providing an alternative source of income. With T2F, providers can offer their services remotely, which expands their reach and provides them with more opportunities to earn.

Another benefit of T2F is that it is cost-effective. Compared to the traditional way of fixing a problem, T2F is a cheaper alternative. Users only need to pay a small amount of money for the service guide, which is a fraction of the cost of hiring a provider to come over physically.

Conclusion:
Tip2Fix is a unique and innovative feature offered by Serch. It allows users to learn how to fix a problem remotely with the guidance of skilled providers. T2F is cost-effective and provides an alternative source of income for providers. Overall, T2F is just one of the many reasons why Serch is a great platform for finding skilled service providers.
