Serch is a platform that connects users with skilled service providers for mechanical, electrical, and plumbing needs. One of the unique features of Serch is the RequestSharing feature, which allows a provider to invite another provider to a service trip if the problem at hand is beyond the initial provider's expertise. In this blog, we will explore how the RequestSharing feature works and the benefits it offers for both providers and users. Got yourself asking these?

**How RequestSharing Works?**

When a provider is on a service trip, they may encounter a problem that goes beyond their area of expertise. Instead of abandoning the job or leaving the user unsatisfied, the provider can use the RequestSharing feature to invite another provider to join them on the service trip. The provider can search for another provider within the provider app based on the needed skill (Electrician, Mechanic, plumber) and invite them to join the service trip.

If the invited provider accepts the invitation, they can collaborate with the initial provider to solve the problem at hand. The money received for the service can be shared between the two providers, based on their agreement. This allows providers to work together and offer a comprehensive solution to the user's problem, without the user having to go through the hassle of finding another provider.

**Benefits of RequestSharing?**

The RequestSharing feature offers several benefits for both providers and users. Here are some of the key advantages:

- Improved Service Quality: When providers collaborate through the RequestSharing feature, they can offer a higher quality of service than they would individually. By working together, they can bring a wider range of expertise to the service trip, which can lead to a more comprehensive solution to the user's problem.

- Increased Earnings: Providers can increase their earnings by collaborating through the RequestSharing feature. By working together, they can take on more complex jobs that they would not be able to handle alone. This can lead to higher earnings for both providers involved.

- Enhanced User Experience: When providers collaborate through the RequestSharing feature, users benefit from a more seamless and convenient experience. They do not have to go through the hassle of finding another provider if the initial provider cannot handle the problem at hand. Instead, the providers take care of everything and offer a comprehensive solution.

In conclusion, the RequestSharing feature offered by Serch is a game-changer for both providers and users. It allows providers to collaborate and offer a higher quality of service, while also increasing their earnings. Users benefit from a more seamless and convenient experience, where they can have a comprehensive solution to their problem. As such, the RequestSharing feature is a testament to the innovation and creativity that Serch brings to the service provider industry.
