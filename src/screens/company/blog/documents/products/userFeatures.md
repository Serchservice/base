Are you planning a service trip using the Serch platform? Here are some features and stips to make your service trip a perfect one.

Create a detailed service request: When creating a service request, be as detailed as possible. This will help the provider to understand the exact problem and come prepared with the necessary tools and equipment to fix it.

Check provider's rating and reviews: Before choosing a provider, check their ratings and reviews from other users. This will give you an idea of their work quality and professionalism.

Communicate clearly with the provider: Once you have chosen a provider, communicate clearly with them regarding the problem you are facing and any other specific requirements you may have.

Use CTG feature: When you are on a service trip with a provider, use the CTG (Connect-To-Go) feature on the Serch app. This will let us know that you are on a service trip with a particular provider and ensure your safety.

Use T2F feature: If you want to learn how to fix a problem yourself, use the Tip2Fix (T2F) feature on the Serch app. This allows you to go on a service guide with the provider using a video call feature, and after the guide, Serch pays the provider a certain amount of money which is deducted from your wallet.
