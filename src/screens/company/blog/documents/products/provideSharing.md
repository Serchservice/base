Serch is a platform that connects users with skilled service providers for mechanical, electrical, and plumbing needs. One of the unique features of Serch is ProvideSharing, which is the ability of a user to share a particular provider to another user, whether the user has an account or not. In this blog, we will explore the know-how of ProvideSharing and how it benefits both providers and users.

How it Works:
If a user wants to share a provider with another user, they can use the ProvideSharing feature on the Serch website or mobile app. They will need to create a unique link that is specific to the provider they want to share. This link can be sent to another user via email, text message, or any other communication method.

When the recipient clicks on the unique link, they will be directed to the provider's profile page on Serch. They can view the provider's ratings, reviews, and other important information before deciding to engage in a service trip with the provider or just check the status of the provider.

Benefits for Users:
ProvideSharing benefits users by making it easier to find and engage with skilled service providers. If a user has had a positive experience with a provider, they can easily share the provider's information with friends, family, or colleagues who may need similar services. This can be particularly helpful for users who are new to an area or who have not used Serch before.

In addition, ProvideSharing allows users to check the status of a provider without having to go through the process of creating an account on Serch. This can be helpful for users who may only need a provider's services once and do not want to go through the hassle of setting up an account.

Benefits for Providers:
ProvideSharing benefits providers by increasing their visibility and exposure to potential clients. If a user shares a provider's link with others, it can lead to more service trips for the provider, resulting in more income and a stronger reputation.

In addition, ProvideSharing allows providers to reach a wider audience beyond the Serch platform. If a provider's link is shared on social media or other online platforms, it can attract new clients who may not have otherwise known about their services.

Conclusion:
ProvideSharing is a unique and innovative feature offered by Serch. It allows users to easily share skilled service providers with others, increasing the visibility and exposure of providers to potential clients. By using this feature, users can find and engage with quality service providers more easily, while providers can attract new clients and earn more income. Overall, ProvideSharing is a win-win for everyone involved and is just one of the many reasons why Serch is a great platform for finding skilled service providers.

How it Works:
If a user finds a skilled service provider that they want to share with another user, they can use the ProvideSharing feature on the user app. They can create a unique link for the provider being shared, and then share it with the other user via email, SMS, or any other messaging app.

When the other user clicks on the link, they will be directed to the provider's profile, where they can engage on a service trip with that provider or just check the status of the provider. It's important to note that the link is unique to the provider being shared and will expire after being used once, ensuring that the provider's privacy and security are protected.

Benefits for Users:
ProvideSharing benefits users in several ways. Firstly, it allows users to share skilled service providers with their friends and family, whether they have an account on the Serch platform or not. This means that users can help their loved ones find the best service providers quickly and easily.

Secondly, it provides an opportunity for users to check the status of a provider before engaging them. By clicking on the unique link, the user can see the provider's ratings, reviews, and availability, ensuring that they are the right fit for the job.

Benefits for Providers:
ProvideSharing also benefits providers by expanding their network and reach. When a user shares a provider with another user, it increases the provider's visibility and chances of being hired for service trips. This can lead to more opportunities for providers to earn and grow their business.

In addition, it provides an opportunity for providers to receive positive ratings and reviews from new users. By providing quality service to the new user, they can leave positive feedback, which can attract more users to engage the provider's services.
