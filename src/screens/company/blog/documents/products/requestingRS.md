Serch's RequestShare feature allows users to share a service provider's details with others via a unique link. This link can be shared with anyone, even those without a Serch account. When someone clicks on the link, they are taken to the service provider's profile where they can view their information and request their services.

If you have received an RS link from someone, and you need to request the services of the provider, here are the steps to follow:

- Step 1: Click on the RS link

    When you receive an RS link, simply click on it to open the service provider's profile page. This page contains the provider's name, profile picture, service offerings, and ratings from previous users.

- Step 2: Review the Provider's Profile

    Once you are on the provider's profile page, take some time to review the information provided. This includes their area of expertise, experience, and any reviews left by previous users. By doing this, you can have an idea of what to expect when you request their services.

- Step 3: Request the Service

    If you are satisfied with the provider's profile, you can proceed to request their services. To do this, click on the "Request Service" button on their profile page. You will be required to provide some details about the service you need, including the date, time, and location.

- Step 4: Wait for Confirmation

    After submitting your service request, the provider will receive a notification and can choose to accept or decline the request. If the provider accepts your request, you will receive a notification and can proceed to arrange the details of the service trip with them.

In conclusion, RequestShare is a convenient feature for users who want to engage the services of a provider without having to go through the hassle of creating an account on the Serch platform. With just a click on an RS link, users can access the services they need and have peace of mind knowing that they are working with a trusted provider on the Serch platform.
