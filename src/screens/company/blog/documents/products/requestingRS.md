Next, the user will be required to fill in a form to provide some necessary details such as their name, location, and the service they require. The user can also add additional information such as the problem they are facing, the time they want the service to be rendered, and other relevant details that the provider may need to know.

Once the user has provided all the necessary information, they can submit the form, and the provider will be notified of the service request. The provider can then accept or decline the request based on their availability, skills, and location.
