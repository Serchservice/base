RequestSharing: If the problem at hand requires more than one service provider, RequestSharing enables a provider to invite another provider to a service trip. This ensures that users receive the best possible service, even if the initial provider does not have the required skills.

ProvideSharing: If you've found a skilled service provider that you'd like to recommend to others, ProvideSharing allows you to create a unique link that can be shared with other users. The link enables the user to engage in a service trip with the provider or just check the status of the provider.

Tip2Fix: If you're looking to learn how to fix a problem yourself, Tip2Fix allows users to request a service guide from a skilled service provider via a video call. This is a cost-effective alternative to traditional service requests, as users only need to pay a small fee for the service guide.
