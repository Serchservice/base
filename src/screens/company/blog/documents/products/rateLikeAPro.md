**For Providers:**

- Be professional: As a provider, it is essential to maintain a professional demeanor at all times. This includes arriving on time, communicating clearly and respectfully with the user, and providing high-quality service. By being professional, you are more likely to receive positive ratings.

- Ask for feedback: After completing a service, ask the user for feedback. This not only helps you improve but also shows that you care about providing excellent service.

- Rate promptly: Like users, providers should rate users promptly after the service has been completed. This ensures that the rating is accurate and that other providers can make informed decisions.

In conclusion, the rating system on Serch is an essential tool that helps users and providers make informed decisions.
