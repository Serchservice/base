Whoohoooo!!! It's finally ***launching time!***, and we are so excited.

We are rolling out our services in three major states in Nigeria, namely Abuja, Enugu, and Delta. These states were chosen due to their high demand for reliable service providers and their willingness to embrace new technology. We aim to provide a convenient, safe, and reliable platform for users to request for services from providers who are skilled in various fields such as plumbing, electrical works, mechanics, and more.

The launch of Serch in Nigeria is a significant step towards solving the challenges faced by users when trying to find service providers who can meet their needs. With the Serch platform, users can easily find providers who are available to provide the required services at any given time. We have taken significant measures to ensure that users feel safe and secure when using the platform. For instance:

- all providers on the Serch platform go through a rigorous verification process to ensure that they possess the required skills and experience.
- Users can also rate and review providers, which serves as a feedback mechanism for us to ensure that only the best providers remain on the platform.

In Abuja, Enugu, and Delta, we are partnering with trusted service providers across our service providing industries (mechanics, plumbers and electricians), to ensure that users have access to our range of services. Our platform's goal is to provide top-notch services that meet the needs of our users, while also creating job opportunities for skilled professionals in the service industry.

One of the advantages of using Serch is that it provides a safe and secure platform for both service providers and users. Our platform takes safety seriously and we put in place various measures to ensure that users have a safe and enjoyable experience. Users can rate and review service providers based on their experience, helping others make informed decisions about which providers to choose.

Additionally, we have implemented safety features such as the ability to share service trips with friends or family members, a **CTG (Connect-To-Go)** feature that lets users know when a particular user is on a service trip with a provider, and a **T2F (Tip2Fix)** feature where users can get service guides from providers through video calls.

The launch of Serch in Nigeria is a welcome development, as it provides users with a safe, reliable, and convenient platform to request for services from skilled providers. We aim at expanding our services to other states in Nigeria, and with our commitment to providing quality services, we are poised at becoming a household name in the Nigeria and the world beyond.
