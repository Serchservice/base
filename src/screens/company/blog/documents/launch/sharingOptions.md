For an on-demand services platform, and as a platform that offers a wide range of services to help individuals and businesses connect with local service providers, we offer a variety of sharing options for both users and providers. These sharing options are designed to cater to the comfortability and preferences of individuals while ensuring maximum convenience and ease of use.

Serch offers two types of sharing options: **Request Sharing (RS)** and **Provide Sharing (PS)**.

**Request Sharing:**

It is when a provider invites another provider to a service trip if the problem is beyond their expertise. This sharing option allows providers to collaborate with each other and provide quality services to their clients. The invited provider can choose to accept or decline the invitation, and if accepted, the initial provider can share their earnings with the invited provider. This is particularly useful for complex issues that require specialized skills. With RequestSharing, a provider can search for other providers within the app based on the required skill (e.g. plumber, electrician, etc.) and invite them to the service trip. The invited provider can share the money received with the original provider, if they agree to do so.

For providers, the requestSharing feature, which allows them to invite another provider to a service trip if the problem the initial provider is there to fix surpasses their ability. This feature helps providers deliver quality services to users, even if they lack the necessary skills to solve certain problems. The invited provider can share the money received with the initial provider, if the invited provider agrees to do so.

**ProvideSharing:**

This feature allows users to share a particular provider with another user, even if the user has no account on Serch. With ProvideSharing, a unique link is created for the provider being shared. The link expires once it is used, ensuring that the provider's details are not shared indiscriminately. This feature helps users get access to quality service providers without necessarily having to search for them manually.

This allow users to share a particular provider with another user, even if the user does not have a Serch account. This creates a unique link that is specific to the provider being shared. When the link is clicked, it will expire and cannot be used again. This feature is particularly useful for users who want to share a provider with friends, family, or colleagues, or for businesses that want to recommend a provider to customers.

We also offer the Tip2Fix feature, which allows users to go on a service guide with a provider using a video call feature. After the guide, Serch pays the provider a certain amount of money, which is deducted from the user's wallet. This feature helps users learn how to fix a problem while paying a cheap amount of money, eliminating the need to physically visit a service provider.

In conclusion, our sharing options are designed to cater to the needs and preferences of individuals, ensuring that they can access quality services easily and conveniently. Whether you are a provider or a user, Serch has got your back. Serch sharing options offer users and providers the flexibility and comfortability they need in accessing and providing services. Users can easily share their providers with others, while providers can collaborate with their colleagues to provide quality services. With Serch, service provision is made easy and convenient for everyone.
