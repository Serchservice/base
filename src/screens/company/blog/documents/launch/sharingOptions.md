Serch, the on-demand services platform, offers a variety of sharing options for both users and providers. These sharing options are designed to cater to the comfortability and preferences of individuals while ensuring maximum convenience and ease of use.

For providers, Serch offers the RequestSharing feature, which allows them to invite another provider to a service trip if the problem the initial provider is there to fix surpasses their ability. This feature helps providers deliver quality services to users, even if they lack the necessary skills to solve certain problems. The invited provider can share the money received with the initial provider, if the invited provider agrees to do so.

On the other hand, ProvideSharing is a feature that allows users to share a particular provider with another user, even if the user has no account on Serch. With ProvideSharing, a unique link is created for the provider being shared. The link expires once it is used, ensuring that the provider's details are not shared indiscriminately. This feature helps users get access to quality service providers without necessarily having to search for them manually.

Serch also offers the Tip2Fix feature, which allows users to go on a service guide with a provider using a video call feature. After the guide, Serch pays the provider a certain amount of money, which is deducted from the user's wallet. This feature helps users learn how to fix a problem while paying a cheap amount of money, eliminating the need to physically visit a service provider.

In conclusion, Serch's sharing options are designed to cater to the needs and preferences of individuals, ensuring that they can access quality services easily and conveniently. Whether you are a provider or a user, Serch has got your back.

Serch is a platform that offers a wide range of services to help individuals and businesses connect with local service providers. Whether you need a plumber, electrician, mechanic, or any other type of service, Serch has got you covered. One of the unique features of Serch is its sharing options, which are designed to give users more control over their service experience.

When it comes to sharing options, Serch offers two main choices: RequestSharing and ProvideSharing. RequestSharing allows providers to invite other providers to join a service trip if the issue exceeds their capabilities. This is particularly useful for complex issues that require specialized skills. With RequestSharing, a provider can search for other providers within the app based on the required skill (e.g. plumber, electrician, etc.) and invite them to the service trip. The invited provider can share the money received with the original provider, if they agree to do so.

On the other hand, ProvideSharing allows users to share a particular provider with another user, even if the user does not have a Serch account. This creates a unique link that is specific to the provider being shared. When the link is clicked, it will expire and cannot be used again. This feature is particularly useful for users who want to share a provider with friends, family, or colleagues, or for businesses that want to recommend a provider to customers.

Both RequestSharing and ProvideSharing are designed to give users more control over their service experience. With these sharing options, users can feel more comfortable and confident when using Serch to find service providers. Whether you're an individual or a business, Serch has got your back.

Serch is a service platform that allows users to find providers for their various needs. One of the unique features of Serch is the sharing option. The sharing option enables users to share their providers with other users who might need their services. This option is available to both individual and business users of Serch.

Serch offers two types of sharing options: Request Sharing (RS) and Provide Sharing (PS). Request Sharing is when a provider invites another provider to a service trip if the problem is beyond their expertise. This sharing option allows providers to collaborate with each other and provide quality services to their clients. The invited provider can choose to accept or decline the invitation, and if accepted, the initial provider can share their earnings with the invited provider.

On the other hand, Provide Sharing allows users to share their providers with other users who might need their services. This sharing option creates a unique link that the user can share with others. Once clicked, the link expires and cannot be used again. This sharing option allows users to recommend their trusted providers to their friends and family without the need for them to search for a provider on the platform.

Serch sharing options offer users and providers the flexibility and comfortability they need in accessing and providing services. Users can easily share their providers with others, while providers can collaborate with their colleagues to provide quality services. With Serch, service provision is made easy and convenient for everyone.
