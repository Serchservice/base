Users can chat, voice or video call with the service provider to agree on the fee to be paid.

**RequestSharing:**

If a service provider encounters a problem that exceeds their skillset, they can use the RequestSharing feature to invite another skilled artisan to the service trip. This helps to ensure that users get the best service possible, even if it requires more than one skilled artisan to fix their problems.

Users can share the details of a skilled artisan they have used in the past with friends and family through the ProvideSharing feature. This helps to connect skilled artisans with more users who need their services, and it also makes it easier for users to find trusted service providers.
