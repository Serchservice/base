If you've ever wondered how your Serch rating is calculated, then this news article is for you. Serch, as a two-way rating platform that allows users to rate providers and providers to rate users, calculate ratings through these means:

Firstly, Serch uses a five-star rating system. Users can rate providers based on their overall service, communication, and punctuality. Providers, on the other hand, can rate users based on their behavior, communication, and payment. To ensure fairness in the rating system, Serch has implemented a system that eliminates any extreme ratings. For example, if a user or provider consistently rates with five stars or one star, their rating will be discounted.

Additionally, Serch takes into account the number of ratings a user or provider has received. If a user or provider only has one rating, it will have a significant impact on their overall rating. However, as more ratings are received, the impact of each individual rating decreases.

It's important to note that Serch reveals the specific ratings or comments left by users or providers. This ensures that providers, especially, see the honest feedbacks from users, and users will only see their rating summary on **MyCentre** rating dashboard. So, if you're a user or provider on Serch, make sure to keep up your good service, communication, and behavior to maintain a high rating. And if you're ever unhappy with a service, leave honest feedback to help improve the Serch community.

These ratings provide valuable insights into the quality of service provided or received, as well as feedback on how to improve for future service trips. Users and providers can access their ratings by logging into their Serch accounts, go to **MyCentre** and click on **"Rating Summary"** option. From there, they can view their overall rating, as well as ratings for specific service trips. Serch ratings are based on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with 5 being the highest rating.

We understand that ratings are important to both users and providers, and we want to make sure that they have access to this information, and by providing transparency into ratings, we hope to help users and providers make more informed decisions when it comes to service trips. In addition to viewing their own ratings, users and providers can also view the ratings of other users and providers before accepting a service trip request. This allows them to make more informed decisions about who they work with and ensures that they receive the best possible service.
