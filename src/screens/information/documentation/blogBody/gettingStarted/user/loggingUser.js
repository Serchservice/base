                It is quite easy to log in to your user account in Serch. All that is needed is your email address and your password.
                If you might have enabled biometrics or passcode before logging out, you can always use fingerprint or passcode.
                This depends on your settings when your account was setup. If perchance your passcode or fingerprint does not work,
                you can always use your email address and your password.
                <br/><br/>
                If you also forget your password, you can always create a new one by sending us the email address. Once your email address
                is received, a link to create a new password is sent to your email. Through the link, you can always create a new password.
                <br/><br/>
                Logging in is only done once. We do not request a log in procedure every moment you want to use our platform.
                This helps to make the usage faster and easier for everyone. However, if you want to log in every time you want to use our
                platform, you can always set it up in your preferences or settings.
