                    <div className="docContents">
                        <p>
                            Venturing into the tech world, we find out that danger can also come from such world, not only from the tech itself,
                            but also from human beings who make use of the goodies that come from the tech world. Therefore, it becomes
                            paramount that one should always be prepared to save oneself from situations endangering to both man and its
                            community. This is one of the goals of most companies, organizations, etcetera. Most have features where they track
                            users and their location, let users state their location or even use the location enabler in mobile devices to
                            track their users. All to protect their users. We appreciate the effort of everyone in protecting each other or
                            themselves.
                            <br/><br/>
                            However, for Serch, we believe in giving man the freedom to choose whether to get help from us when it comes to
                            protection, or rather to go solo. We allow the user or provider to let us protect them through our security features
                            per any work or service. This helps in giving the user or the provider an upper hand in determining in whether they
                            can protect themselves or whether we should come in for the meantime. We do this because, since we are not entirely
                            concerned with the whereabout of the user or provider, we try to also let them know that we are still going to
                            protect them only when they want us to.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Therefore, we say to them, “We not only serve as the middle person between your potential customers and your skills.
                            We also serve as your superman when you are cornered.”  We also have the
                            <a href="#all_about_the_sgcommunity"> Safe-Guard Community</a> which helps in improving our security formats through
                            family discussions from our providers, users and anyone else.

                    <h3>2.  Security Features</h3>
                    <div className="subHeaders">
                        <h4>a.	Stick-With-Me (SWM)</h4>
                        <div className="docContents">
                            <p>
                                SWM is a security feature meant only for providers. With SWM, the provider can share its location to any person
                                through any media means. The persons whom the location is shared to, can track the provider on its journey to
                                place of service and even back to the provider’s beginning location. That is why it is named, Stick-With-Me.
                                SWM can be used to track the provider should anything feel wrong and can also be used to locate the provider.
                                This security feature can only be stopped by the provider with a pin code known only to the provider. Unless
                                the mobile phone is off, SWM can be very much helpful and active, should there be any problem.
                                <br/><br/>
                                We do encourage providers to enable SWM before going for any service, however, like we said, our protection
                                supermen can only function if the provider wants it. If the user enabled “ping for me,” then, upon accepting
                                request, the provider will also see the SWM button so as to click on whether to enable SWM or not for such
                                request method.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <h4>b.	Connect-To-Go (CTG)</h4>
                        <div className="docContents">
                            <p>
                                CTG, like its name implies, is only attributed to users. We encourage users to enable CTG before they end the
                                call with the provider or end the chat with the provider. By enabling the CTG, the provider discussing with the
                                user is notified of the connection, and if accepted, the provider will input the provider’s location and with
                                that, the user can see the provider’s movement till the end of the service period which will be stopped only
                                by the user with a pin code.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Seeing the provider’s movement can come in handy if the service was booked or scheduled when the user won’t be
                                around the vicinity of the service provision. This enables the user to get notified upon the arrival of the
                                provider than for the user to receive a call from the provider.
                            </p>
