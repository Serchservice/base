                            With our devotedness to security for both providers and users, we have created a community where security issues
                            can be discussed, analyzed and implemented if it is going to keep everyone safe. As an inclusive community we are,
                            we also created the community to serve as a ground for everyone to pitch in what they think would be better, without
                            any discrimination or prejudice. We listen to all kinds of idea and we analyze all kinds of idea also. Analyzing all
                            kinds of idea is also left to the community to vote on. The more vote an idea has, the more attention is gets from
                            the Serch team.

                            As a community with the sole goal of improving our security measures, we also have community guidelines which make
                            sure that every member of the community sticks to the community goals. We reserve all rights to terminate any member
                            who violate any of our rules, and we also reserve the right to do away with any material that does not stick to our
                            guidelines:

                        <p>
                            As much as we value our providers and users, it is also our priority to make sure that each of these get the
                            top-notch services and top-notch users they are obligated to get through our services. Which is why we so much
                            encourage the ideology of rating among our users and providers. Not only do we encourage our users and providers
                            to rate themselves, we also encourage everyone to rate our services so as to let us know how we can improve our
                            services. Inasmuch as we have <a href="mailto:improve@serchservice.com">improve@serchservice.com</a> email which
                            it’s sole goal its to read and make a general analysis on what the users are saying about our services, how we can
                            improve them and things we should remove or encourage, we also want our users to rate our providers and our
                            providers to rate our users.
                            <br/><br/>
                            The effect of this rating enables us to track what our users are doing whenever they get connected to our providers.
                            It also enables to understand what our providers have the capability of doing. By understanding and knowing these,
                            we are able to curate our services to suit the taste of both the user and the provider. Rating enables us to do
                            these many things:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <span className="bold">a.</span>	Let the user or the provider know what they did wrong and how to correct it.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span className="bold">b.</span>	Correct the user or the provider if they don’t listen to the first correction
                                through series of corrective measures which will be mentioned to the user or provider upon first warning or
                                correction.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span className="bold">c.</span>	Put the user or provider on a suspension if they persistently ignore our
                                warnings.
