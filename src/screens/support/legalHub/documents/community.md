## Introduction

Our guidelines were developed to help make every experience safe, respectful, and positive. They apply to everyone who uses Serch’s platform, including but not limited to providers, clients, Serch for Individual, and Serch for Business. It also includes interactions you may have with Serch employees and contractors, through online support systems, or over the phone. Thank you for joining us in supporting and safeguarding a welcoming environment.
We update our guidelines regularly to address relevant behavior and risks. Our goal is to ensure that everybody in the Serch community always feels safe and welcome. Please take a moment to read them.

## Guideline for all of us

Everyone who signs up for a Serch account is required to follow Serch’s Community Guidelines. They reflect the following 4 pillars and the standards in each of these sections.

***Treat everyone with respect***

Our community is remarkably diverse and, chances are, you may meet people who may look different from you, think differently than you, or come from different backgrounds. The guidelines in this section help to foster positive interactions during every experience.

***Help keep one another safe***

We’re hard at work every day to help create safer experiences for everyone. Your safety drives us. That’s why these standards were written.

***Follow the law***

We’re committed to following all applicable laws and earning your trust, and we expect everyone who uses the Serch platform to do their part and adhere to relevant laws and regulations.

***Your feedback matters***

If something happens, whether it’s good or bad, we make it easy for you to tell us directly in the app or by contacting the Serch Support team. Our team is continually improving our standards and policies, and your feedback is important so that we can take appropriate action to keep our standards relevant as our technology evolves.

## Treat everyone with respect

Treat everyone in the Serch community as you would like to be treated yourself: with respect. The actions you take while using the Serch Platform can have a big impact on the safety and comfort of others. Courtesy matters. That’s why you are expected to exercise good judgment and behave decently toward other people when using the Serch Platform and interacting with others in the Serch community—just as you would in any public place. This includes behavior toward the Serch Support team.

Serch is an anti-racist company. We are committed to creating a safe and welcoming space for everyone, regardless of background. Remember that when you interact with others in the Serch community, you may meet people who may look different from you, think differently than you, or come from different backgrounds. Please respect those differences. Discrimination based on race or any other characteristic protected by law will not be tolerated on the Serch Platform and can result in loss of access to the apps. Additionally, if you witness discrimination taking place, you can report the situation to Serch and we will address any report in accordance with our policies.

We believe that everyone should feel supported and welcomed when interacting with others in the Serch community. That’s why we’ve created standards and policies on physical contact, sexual assault and misconduct, threatening and rude behavior, post-trip contact, discrimination, and property damage.

Respect isn’t always tied to what you say; it is also about how you act. For example, always try to be on time for your service delivery and service receival. It’s also common courtesy not to shout, swear, or slam doors. And by tidying up after yourself, you’ll help ensure that everyone has a pleasant experience.

### Physical contact

No one on the Serch Platform should be touched without their consent, period. Don’t touch strangers or anyone you just met while using the Serch Platform. Limited exceptions are permitted for people needing or requesting physical assistance. Hurting or intending to hurt anyone is never allowed.

### Sexual assault and misconduct

We all value our personal space and privacy. It’s OK to chat with other people while remaining respectful. But please don’t comment on someone’s appearance or ask whether they are single. Sexual assault and sexual misconduct of any kind is prohibited. Sexual assault and misconduct refer to sexual contact or behavior without explicit consent of the other person. Personal space and privacy should be respected. The following list provides examples of inappropriate conduct but is not exhaustive.

* Do not ask personal questions (for example, about relationship status or sexual orientation)
* Do not comment on appearance (for example, derogatory or “complimentary” comments)
* Do not make explicit comments or gestures (for example, slurs, or graphic or suggestive messages)
* Do not flirt (for example, nonverbal, suggestive flirting, or being too physically close)
* Do not display indecent material (for example, sexually suggestive objects or pictures)
* Serch has a no-sex rule regardless of whether you know the person or they give you their consent

### Threatening and rude behavior

Aggressive, confrontational, or harassing behavior is not allowed. Don’t use language, make gestures, or take actions that could be disrespectful, discriminatory, threatening, or inappropriate. The following list provides examples of threatening or rude behavior but is not exhaustive.

* Do not share graphic images or other harmful content (such as those that are sexually explicit or depict violence) with others in the Serch community; this includes unsolicited sharing of such images through Serch’s online support systems or in connection with an Serch Platform experience
* Stay away from personal topics that can potentially be divisive, like religion and political beliefs
* Do not make verbal or physical threats of violence toward anybody
* Do not use derogatory or discriminatory language, such as racist or prejudiced comments or slurs, for any reason

If you are the recipient of, or witness to any threatening or rude behavior, you can report the situation to Serch and we will address any report in accordance with our policies.

### Post-service contact

Contact should end when the service is complete, unless it’s to return a requested item. Unwanted contact can be seen as harassment and includes, for example, texting, calling, social media contact, visiting, or trying to visit someone in person after a service has been completed. Do not share any unnecessary contact information.

### Discrimination

You should always feel safe and welcome. That’s why we don’t tolerate racist or discriminatory conduct and behavior, including toward the Serch Support team. We encourage you to engage in all interactions with empathy, inclusivity, and intent to provide an anti-racist, anti-discriminatory space for everyone. Do not discriminate against someone or engage in a disparaging manner toward someone based on traits such as their race, ethnicity, skin color, age, disability, gender identity, marital status, pregnancy, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, language, geographical location, or any other characteristic protected under relevant law.

The following list provides examples of discriminatory behavior but is not exhaustive.

* Do not refuse to provide services based on characteristics like a person’s race, ethnicity, skin color, age, disability, gender identity, marital status, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, language, geographical location, or any other characteristic protected under relevant law.
* Do not rate another user—whether providers, clients, merchants, or businesses—based on these traits.
* Do not discriminate on the basis of a provider’s destination. We understand how important it is to fit moving about for repairs, installations, etc. around your life, rather than the other way around. It is not a violation of these guidelines to decline a service request because it does not work for you. But intentionally refusing or canceling requests, or using features on the Serch Platform to avoid receiving service requests, solely for the purpose of avoiding a particular neighborhood due to the characteristics of the people or businesses that are located in that area, is not allowed.
* Do not use discriminatory language, make discriminatory remarks, vilify, or ask questions about sensitive topics regarding national origin, race, ethnicity, or any other trait previously mentioned. Making racial comments or using slurs is never allowed.

You can learn more about Serch’s Non-Discrimination Policy [here.](/legal/document/non-discrimination-policy)

If you are subject to discrimination or witness discriminatory behavior, you can report the incident to Serch by tapping Help in the apps or visiting [help.serchservice.com](https://help.serchservice.com) so that our Support team can follow up and take the appropriate action. Call the necessary authority in your country for immediate assistance if you feel like your safety is in danger. Serch takes report of discriminatory behavior very seriously. Any users found to have engaged in discriminatory behavior or used discriminatory language may lose access to the Serch Platform.

### Property damage

Damaging property is never allowed. Some examples include damaging the service tools of the service provider requested through the Serch Platform, breaking or vandalizing a phone or tablet, damaging a client’s property while on service, etc. If you damage property, you’re responsible for the cost of repair fees, outside of normal wear and tear.

## Help keep one another safe

Everyone has a role to play in helping to create a safe environment. That’s why we have standards on account sharing, account holder age, and more.

### Account sharing

Account sharing is not allowed. To use the Serch Platform, you need to register and maintain an active account. Don’t let another person use your account, and never share your personal information used in connection with your account, including but not limited to username, password, or photos of yourself, with anyone else to access the Serch Platform.

### People under the age of 18

You must be 18 years or older to have a Serch account. Account holders can’t request for service on behalf of someone under the age of 18 who will not be accompanied by either the account holder or another adult during the service repair period. These age limitations apply unless your local guidelines, terms, or other policies say otherwise.

### Extra clients and non-account clients

When servicing with Serch, no one other than the provider and/or the assisting provider, the requesting client, and the client’s guests should be involved. These guidelines apply unless your local guidelines, terms, or other policies say otherwise. When servicing with Serch, the account holder is responsible for the behavior of their entire party. If you request a service for another adult, you’re held responsible for their behavior during their service period.

### Be alert

Being out on a service trip means doing your part to help keep yourself and others safe. This means keeping your eyes on the service and being well rested, so you can quickly react to any situation. We review reports of errors and potentially unsafe servicing behavior.

### Proper maintenance and upkeep

Pursuant to the terms of their agreement with Serch, providers are expected to keep their tools maintained and in good operating condition, including but not limited to their personal transportation means. This means maintaining their operating tools according to industry safety and maintenance standards, and monitoring for and repairing any parts that are recalled by their manufacturers.

### Public emergencies

Serch may take additional measures to try to preserve the safety of our platform during public emergencies, including but not limited to natural disasters, public health emergencies, and public crisis situations.

For example, if Serch receives notice from a public health authority that someone using the Serch Marketplace Platform may present a potential for public harm, we may temporarily block the individual’s access until it is reasonably safe to allow the individual to resume using the Serch Marketplace Platform. Similarly, we may prevent individuals in an entire city or region from using part or all of the Serch Marketplace Platform or impose other requirements to comply with guidance from authorities during a time of public health emergency, natural disaster, or other public crisis situation, or when the continued availability of the Serch Marketplace Platform might present a danger.

## Follow the law

We have standards based on applicable laws and regulations that everyone must follow. For example, using the Serch Marketplace Platform to commit any crime—such as sexually exploiting children, plotting theft or robbery, kidnapping—or to violate any other law is strictly prohibited

### Follow all laws

Everyone is responsible for knowing and obeying all applicable laws at all times when using the Serch Marketplace Platform. All relevant licenses, permits, and any other legal documents required of providers must be kept up to date. For example, all providers using a personal vehicle are required by law to maintain a valid driver’s license, insurance, and vehicle registration.

For requestSharing and provideSharing, it is imperative that both parties recognize Serch laws which also includes meeting the applicable regulatory requirements for requestShare or for-hire providers in your area. For clients, let your provider handle the servicing. For example, for clients, don’t touch the components that are when operating on your problem.

### Drugs and alcohol

Drug use and open containers of alcohol are never allowed while using the Serch Marketplace Platform. If you’re a provider, by law you cannot service while intoxicated. The law prohibits working while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or any other substance that impairs your ability to safely operate on a given problem. If you encounter a client who is too drunk or rowdy, you have the right to decline the request for your own safety. If you’re client and you have reason to believe your provider may be under the influence of drugs or alcohol, ask the provider to end the request immediately. Then, please report your experience to Serch.

### Firearms ban

Clients and their guests, as well as providers, are prohibited from carrying firearms while using the Serch Marketplace Platform, to the extent permitted by applicable law. You can learn more about our Firearms Prohibition Policy [here](/).

### Fraud

Deception can weaken trust and also be dangerous. Intentionally falsifying information or assuming someone else’s identity, for example when signing in or undergoing a security check, isn’t allowed. It is important to provide accurate information when reporting incidents, creating and accessing your Serch accounts and subscribing to a Serch plan. Only provide services that you’re entitled to (as you have subscribed), and use offers and promotions only as intended. Don’t knowingly complete invalid transactions.

Fraudulent activity may also include, but not be limited to:

* accepting service request without the intention to complete, including requesting for the wrong provider just to make use of the ProvideShare feature;
* creating dummy accounts for fraudulent purposes;
* claiming fraudulent fees or charges, like false repair fees;
* intentionally requesting, accepting, or completing fraudulent or falsified service requests;
* claiming to complete a Tip2Fix without ever going for the service;
* actions intended to disrupt or manipulate the normal functioning of the Serch Marketplace Platform, including manipulating the settings on a phone to prevent the proper functioning of the platform and the GPS system;
* abusing promotions and/or not using them for their intended purpose;
* disputing charges for fraudulent or illegitimate reasons;
* creating improper duplicate accounts; or falsifying documents, records, or other data for fraudulent purposes.

### Street calls and off-platform requests

To enhance the safety of each experience, off-platform requests are prohibited. The law prohibits street calls while using the Serch Marketplace Platform, so never solicit or accept payment outside the Serch Marketplace Platform. Clients should not request services from providers outside of the Serch Marketplace Platform.

### Other unacceptable activities

Never use Serch’s trademark or intellectual property without permission. If it’s required under local law to display Serch-branded items, providers should only use Serch-branded items that are obtained from Serch. Providers should not display Serch-branded items when they are not accessing the platform. Providers should also return Serch-branded items to Serch if they lose access to the platform. The use of unauthorized or third-party items—such as lights, placards, signs, or similar items bearing Serch’s name or trademark—may confuse clients or users.

## Your feedback matters

If something happens, whether it’s good or bad, we make it easy for you to tell us. Our team is continually improving our standards, and your feedback is important to keep our standards relevant as our technology evolves. Please rate your experience at the end of each request.

Honest feedback helps ensure that everyone is accountable for their behavior. This accountability helps create a respectful, safe environment. And if something happens and you want to report it, you can tap Help in the app or visit [help.serchservice.com](https://help.serchservice.com) so that our Support team can follow up. In case of an emergency or if you find yourself in immediate danger, alert your local authorities or emergency services before notifying Serch.

### Ratings

Providers and clients can give and receive ratings, as well as give feedback on how the trip went. This feedback system improves accountability and helps create a respectful, safe, and transparent environment for everyone. Providers and Clients can see their rating displayed under their name by opening the app and touching the **MyCentre**. You can also find a detailed analysis of your rating when you visit the **Rating Tab** in the **MyCentre** page of the Serch app or web.

There is a minimum average rating in each city. This is because there may be cultural differences in the way people in different cities rate each other. Providers and Clients that don’t meet the minimum average rating for their city may lose access to all or part of the Serch Marketplace Platform. If your rating is approaching this limit, we will let you know and may share information that may help you improve your rating.

If you’re looking to keep your average rating high, it’s helpful to be courteous and respectful to all people while using the Serch Marketplace Platform and interacting with others in the Serch community. Providers using the Serch Marketplace Platform typically provide excellent service to their clients, and most clients and providers are courteous and respectful, so most requests run smoothly. Contacting Support will not lead to an individual rating being removed. We know that sometimes a request doesn’t go well—that’s why your rating is an average rating.

If you’re a provider and you lose access to your Serch account for low ratings, you may have the opportunity to get back on the job if you meet eligibility requirements and provide proof that you’ve successfully taken a quality improvement course offered by third-party experts. Check with the Serch Support team, or go to [help.serchservice.com](https://help.serchservice.com) to find out more.

### Service request acceptance

If you’re a provider and you don’t want to accept service requests, you can just go offline or log off. This helps keep the system running smoothly for everyone.

For providers, if you consistently decline consecutive service requests, our technology may assume you do not want to accept more services or have forgotten to log out, and you may be temporarily logged out. However, you are free to log back in whenever you wish to begin confirming availability for services again. Intentionally refusing or canceling requests, or using features on the Serch Marketplace Platform to avoid receiving service requests, due to someone’s protected characteristics or for the purpose of avoiding a particular neighborhood due to the characteristics of the people or businesses that are located in that area, is not allowed.

## How Serch enforces our guidelines

Losing access to the Serch Marketplace Platform may be disruptive to your life or to your business. That’s why we believe it is important to have clear standards that explain the circumstances in which you may lose access to the Serch Marketplace Platform. If you violate any terms of your contractual agreement with Serch, or any applicable terms or policies, including any one of these Community Guidelines or any additional policies and standards that are communicated by Serch to you from time to time, you can lose access to all or part of the Serch Marketplace Platform. If you have more than one Serch account, such as a provider account and a client account, violating the Community Guidelines could also lead you to lose access to all Serch accounts. If you believe an error caused you to lose access to your account, you may contact the Serch Support team.

Serch receives feedback through a variety of channels, reviews reports submitted to our Support team that may violate our Community Guidelines, and may investigate through a specialized team. If we are made aware of potentially problematic behavior, we may contact you so we can look into it. We may, at our sole discretion, put a hold on your account or turn your account inactive until our review is complete.

Not following any one of our guidelines may result in the loss of access to all or part of the Serch Marketplace Platform. This can include reported violations of our Community Guidelines and certain actions you may take outside of the Serch Marketplace Platform, including but not limited to information from other platforms, if we determine that those actions threaten the safety of the Serch community, our employees, and contractors, or cause harm to Serch’s brand, reputation, or business. And if the issues raised are serious or a repeat report, or you refuse to cooperate, you may lose access to the Serch Marketplace Platform. Any behavior involving discrimination, violence, sexual misconduct, harassment, fraud, or deceptive, illegal, or unsafe activity, while using the Serch Marketplace Platform can result in the immediate loss of access to the Serch Marketplace Platform. Additionally, when law enforcement is involved, we will cooperate with their investigation in accordance with our Guidelines for Law Enforcement Authorities for the US, found here, and for outside the US, found here.

Many states and cities regulate the provision of certain services, including request services, on the Serch Marketplace Platform. If we determine that your provider account is not in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be required to remove your access to the Serch Marketplace Platform.
