1. **Billing Cycle.** The membership fee for Serch service and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on the **"MyCentre"** page. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you signed-up for the service. In some cases, your payment date may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled, when you change your subscription plan or if your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month.

    Every payment date is scheduled on the 30th of each month. Whereas for months that do not have 30, Serch payment date calculates 30 days from last or new paid membership.

    We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it for up to approximately one month of service as soon as you register. If you signed up for Serch using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, you can find the billing information about your Serch membership by visiting your account with the applicable third party.

You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated to your account in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method.

    For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Local tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.
3. **Updating your Payment Methods**. You can update your Payment Methods by going to the **"MyCentre"** page. We may also update your Payment Methods using information provided by the payment service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s).

To the extent permitted by the applicable law, payments are non-refundable and we do not provide refunds or credits for any partial membership periods or unused Serch service. To cancel, go to the **"MyCentre"** page and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. To see when your account will close, click **"My Plan"** on the **"MyCentre"** page.

    If you signed up for Serch using your account with a third party as a Payment Method and wish to cancel your Serch membership, you may need to do so through such third party, for example by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from Serch service through that third party.
