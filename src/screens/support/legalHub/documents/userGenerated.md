These Terms may also be subject to other agreements you have with Serch and/or applicable terms. **PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY, AS THEY CONSTITUTE A LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND SERCH**. In these Terms, the words “including” and "include” mean “including, but not limited to.”

## 1. Serch’s role regarding User Generated Content

You acknowledge that Serch is an online service provider and is not a publisher of UGC; nonetheless, Serch may, but shall not be obligated to, review or monitor UGC and may, in its sole discretion, refuse to display, remove, edit, or disable UGC for any reason, including if Serch determines that UGC may negatively affect Serch or that UGC violates these Terms, the General Community Guidelines, the terms of any other agreement either located at serchservice.com/legal or that you have with Serch, any UGC or other content creation guidelines and/or policies that may be provided to you by Serch from time to time, or applicable codes, laws, legislation, licenses, orders (including court orders), ordinances, rules, regulations, or any other requirement imposed by a government authority. Serch does not endorse or approve any UGC available on the Services. Serch has the right to display any UGC submitted by You on its platform(s) in accordance with these Terms and shall have the right to combine such UGC with any UGC created by other Users, as well as any content created by Serch itself.

## 2. License to User Generated Content

UGC remains your property; however, you grant Serch a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, and otherwise exploit in any manner such UGC in all formats and distribution channels now known or hereafter devised (including in connection with the Services and Serch's business, and on third-party sites and services), without further notice to or consent from you, and without the requirement of payment to you or any other person or entity.

## 3. Representations and Warranties

You represent and warrant that:
    (i)	you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all UGC or you have all rights, licenses, consents and releases necessary to grant Serch the license to the UGC as set forth above;

(iii)	you assume all risks (including accuracy and reliability) associated with the content and shall not imply in any UGC that the content is endorsed or verified by Serch. When providing UGC or otherwise using the Services, you agree that you will not:
a.	Do or allow to be done, anything which will or is reasonably likely to adversely affect the Services or Serch.

You agree that the provisions in this section will survive any termination of your account or this Agreement.

## 5. Violation of Terms

If you or someone using your account with Serch violates these Terms or fails to remedy a violation after a warning, Serch may take action against you, including revoking access to certain or all of the Services, or terminating your account. In case of severe violations, Serch may take these actions without issuing a prior warning.
