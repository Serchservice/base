# Serch Referral Programme Rules

Thank you for helping to grow our community. From time to time, Serch, its subsidiaries and its affiliates ("Serch") may invite you to participate in one of their referral programmes to encourage people to use the Serch applications and/or websites. Participating in a referral programme (either by referring your friends or family or signing up with a referral link or code) can be a great way for clients, providers and guests (other users of Serch apps) (collectively "Serch users") to receive discounts or earn extra incentives or money (each a "Referral Reward").

Serch Referral Programme rules (the "Rules") apply to referral programmes that are administered solely by Serch. By accepting and sharing your referral link or code or by signing up with a referral link or code, you are agreeing to be bound by these Rules. Any violation of these Rules will not only prevent you from participating in any Serch referral programme (now or in the future), but could also result in the forfeiture or retraction of Serch credits, money or other rewards earned through the programme, and even the deactivation of your account.

In addition, there may be other terms that apply to your Referral Reward based on the city where you signed up, including what actions you may need to take as well as the type and amount of the Referral Reward. See the additional terms that came with your invitation or those provided in our app or website when you made your referral.

Please note that these Rules are in addition to the Terms of Use as updated from time to time and can be found here* - governing your use of Serch's apps as well as any agreement (if one exists) between you and Serch or any of its subsidiaries and affiliates related to your interactions with Serch.

## 1.	Who is eligible to be a referrer/inviter?
Anyone can be a referrer/inviter who
(a) is a legal resident of his/her country,
(b) is of legal age where they live and
(c) has an Serch account in good standing.
Referrers/inviters can be any type of Serch user, but they cannot have more than one account for each Serch product or service.

## 2.	Who is eligible to be a referee/invitee?

Your friends, family and other people you know (but not you) may be eligible to be referees/invitees. To determine eligibility, bear in mind the following stipulations:

### Eligible referees/invitees for those who order services through the Serch applications and/or websites:

To receive a Referral Reward for referring someone who orders services through the Serch applications and/or websites, your referee/invitee must
(a) be a new Serch user of that service or a user who has not used the Serch service within a certain period of time,
(b) meet the conditions Serch has for using the app, and
(c) complete the actions required by the specific referral programme (purely for example purposes, takes a request arranged through the Serch app or any other action as applicable).

### Eligible referees/invitees for those who provide services through the Serch applications and/or websites:

To receive a Referral Reward for referring someone who provides services through the Serch applications and/or websites, your referee/invitee must
(a) meet the eligibility criteria noted in the referral invite or offer (e.g., invitee must not have previously provided or signed up to provide with Serch, or perhaps is an existing account holder but has not provided with Serch within a certain period of time, as noted in the referral offer);
(b) meet all the conditions Serch has for becoming a provider;
(c) use your referral link or code when they sign up to provide, or activate the offer, as is applicable;
(d) complete the specific number of requests within the time period specified by the programme; (e) take any other actions required by the specific referral programme; and
(f) unless otherwise indicated in the offer, sign up or activate the offer within 90 days of the referral invitation being sent.

Your referees/invitees can only be referred once, so if someone else has referred them and they have accepted that invitation, they will not be able to accept yours.

Referrers/inviters cannot: request themselves as a clients or other user, pre-arrange services with clients, get someone else to provide for them, create duplicate/multiple accounts, accept requests without the intention of completing them, claim false fees or charges, manipulate request details, or do anything else prohibited by Serch's Community Guidelines, which may be updated from time to time and can be found here.*

If you are providing Serch with the contact information for your referees/invitees, you represent that you have the right to provide that information.

Invitees/referees who use a referral link or code or activate a referral offer must agree to share their progress toward the required number of requests noted in the offer (request count information) with the inviter. Once the invitee/referee completes the requirements specified in the offer or when the referral programme expires, whichever is earlier, such sharing will cease.

## 3.	How can I use my referral link or code?

Serch has the right to limit the number of times you may use or share your referral link or code based on the referral programme in which you participate. To see if your link or code has a limit, refer to the terms of the specific referral programme in which you are participating.

Serch wants you to share your referral link or code and earn Referral Rewards, but referral links or codes must be used only for personal and non-commercial purposes. This means that you can share your referral link or code only with people you know. You agree that you will not:
1.	Duplicate, sell, or transfer your referral link or code in any manner or make it available to the general public (such as by printing it on business cards, posting it on a coupon website, job website or using it as part of a job application, including, but not limited to, the following website and applications: Amazon, EBay, Fiverr, Craigslist, RetailMeNot, Reddit, Wikipedia, Gumtree, Moneysavingexpert, Groupon or using paid social media or paid search);
2.	Try to get referees/invitees by spamming, bulk emailing or sending large numbers of unsolicited emails. The only people you should be emailing are people you know personally;
3.	Use, display or manipulate Serch intellectual property (such as Serch's logos, trademarks and copyright-protected works) in any way, except to identify yourself as an Serch user, Serch referrer/inviter or referrer/inviter for Serch;
4.	Create or register any (i) businesses, (ii) URLs, (iii) domain names, (iv) software application names or titles, or (v) social media handles or profiles that include the word "Serch" or any of Serch's other trademarks or any words that are confusingly similar to Serch's trademarks.
5.	Use Serch's trademarks as your social media profile picture or wallpaper or use any of Serch's copyright-protected works (such as graphics, photos, images, drawings and screenshots from Serch's website or app) without Serch's express written permission;
6.	Purchase keywords (including but not limited to Google AdWords) that contain any of Serch's trademarks;
7.	Use automated systems or bots through any channel to distribute, post or otherwise share your referral link or code;
8.	Use scripts or programmed or automatic dialers to send invites or otherwise share your referral link or code;
9.	Make misleading claims about Serch, use offensive/abusive content, create fake websites/webpages/social media profiles/apps, misrepresent your connection to Serch, or otherwise make any false or misleading statements to get a referee/invitee to use your link or code; or
10.	Use your referral link or code in any manner that violates the law or the rights of anyone else.

Remember, when you share your referral link or code, you should explain that you are an Serch referrer.

## 4.	How do I earn my Referral Reward as a referrer/inviter?

As long as you and your referee/invitee follow these Rules and the Terms of Use governing your use of Serch's apps and you have an activated account, you should receive your Referral Reward after your referee/invitee uses your link or code to sign up with Serch and/or to activate the referral offer, and completes the requirements for the particular Referral Reward (such as completing the minimum number of requests for providers and taking a request for clients.

For provider referrals, each completed service request counts as one completed request toward the minimum requests required to redeem a referral offer. Cancelled requests do not count towards these minimum requirements. ***Note that unless stated otherwise on the referral offer, all referral invitations will expire 90 days from send date and all Referral Rewards will expire, in the case of a new provider, 90 days after the date that the invitee signs up as a provider, or, in the case of an existing provider, 90 days from the date your invitee activates the referral offer by using your referral link or code.***

Referrers are limited to a combined total of 50 referral payouts. Referral Rewards are discretionary and the amount of a Referral Reward and the requirements to get it can vary both by city and within a city. As a result, if your referee/invitee signs up in a city that is different from yours, they may receive a different referral offer than the one stated in your invitation (they may receive the offer available in their sign-up city) and the offer as well as the Referral Reward amount will be confirmed upon the invitee/referee signing up using your referral link or code. Likewise, if your invitee is an existing provider and activates the referral offer in a city that is different from yours, they may receive a different offer than the one stated in your invitation and the offer as well as the Referral Reward amount will be confirmed upon the referee/invitee activating the offer using your referral link or code. This means you might end up with a different Referral Reward than you thought. Please note that, although you can invite someone in a different city, you cannot invite anyone in a different country.

Serch reserves the right to set a limit on the number of times you may use your referral link or code. The requirements for receiving, and the amounts of, Referral Rewards are subject to change at Serch's sole discretion. Referral Rewards in the form of Serch credits are not transferable, have no cash value and may expire.

## 5.	How can I earn a Referral Reward as a referee/invitee?

For requests, referees/invitees may get a discount the first time they use the Serch applications and/or websites. The amount and form of the discount will be shown in their invitation. For providers, referees/invitees may be eligible for special offers based on the number of requests they serviced after signing up through an invitation. The terms of those offers will be shown in their invitation.

## 6.	Termination and changes

Serch reserves the right to change, end or pause, in whole or in part, any referral programme, as well as any referrer/inviter's or referee/invitee's ability to participate in any referral programme or receive Referral Rewards at any time for any reason, including suspected fraud (including by either the referrer and/or referee/invitee), abuse or any violation of these Rules as well as any agreement (if one exists) between you and Serch or any of its subsidiaries and affiliates. If Serch ends any referral programme, any unused or unredeemed Referral Rewards may be forfeited at that time, provided that we give you 14 days of notice to use or redeem your Referral Rewards.

Serch may update these Rules at any time. If Serch makes an update, Serch will post the update on the Serchservice.com website and applications and provide you with notice of the update. Continued participation in any referral programme after any update will mean that you have agreed to the update.
