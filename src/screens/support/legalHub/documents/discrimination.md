Serch seeks to ignite opportunity by setting the world in motion and striving to provide safe, reliable, and high-quality service options to everyone. Serch and its affiliates therefore prohibit discrimination against users based on race, religion, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, sex, marital status, gender identity, age or any other characteristic protected under applicable law. Such discrimination includes, but is not limited to, any user refusing to provide or accept services based on any of these characteristics. Any user found to have violated this prohibition will lose access to the Serch platform.

Applicable laws in certain jurisdictions may require and/or allow the provision of services by and for the benefit of a specific category of persons. In such jurisdictions, services provided in compliance with these laws and the relevant applicable terms are permissible under this policy.
