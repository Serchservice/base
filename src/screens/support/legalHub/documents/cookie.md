## Introduction

We and our affiliates, 3rd-parties, and other partners use cookies and other identification technologies on our websites, mobile applications, email communications, advertisements, and other online services (collectively, the ‘Services’) for a number of purposes, including: authenticating users, remembering user preferences and settings, determining the popularity of content, delivering and measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, analyzing site traffic and trends, and generally understanding the online behaviors and interests of people who interact with our Services. You can read more here about the types of cookies we use, why we use them, and how you can exercise your choices.

## Cookies and Related Technologies Overview

Cookies are small text files that are stored on your browser or device by websites, apps, online media, and advertisements that are used to remember your browser or device during and across website visits. We also utilize other technologies that may identify you or the devices you use. For example, ‘pixel tags’ (also called beacons) are small blocks of code installed on (or called by) a webpage, app, or advertisement which can retrieve certain information about your device and browser, including, for example: device type, operating system, browser type and version, website visited, time of visit, referring website, IP address, advertising identifiers, and other similar information, including the small text file (the cookie) that uniquely identifies the device.

Pixels provide the means by which third-parties can set and read browser cookies from a domain that they do not themselves operate and collect information about visitors to that domain, typically with the permission of the domain owner. ‘Local storage’ refers generally to other places on a browser or device where information can be stored by websites, ads, or third-parties (such as HTML5 local storage and browser cache). ‘Software Development Kits’ (also called SDKs) function like pixels and cookies, but operate in the mobile app context where pixels and cookies cannot always function. The primary app developer can install pieces of code (the SDK) from partners in the app, and thereby allow the partner to collect certain information about user interaction with the app and information about the user device and network information.

## Advertising Synchronization & Relevancy

In order to facilitate the most relevant ads possible, Serch works with various service providers who assist us in delivering similar ads to end users across devices and platforms. For example, we work with social media advertising services to provide you with relevant ads based on your Serch activity through their media channels. We may also use service providers to provide you with a similar ad on a mobile website or mobile application as with a traditional website ad. See below for more information on your choices to limit these types of advertising.

## Your Choices

You have the right to choose whether or not to accept cookies. However, they are an important part of how our Services work, so you should be aware that if you choose to refuse or remove cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of the Services.

Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. To do so, please follow the instructions provided by your browser which are usually located within the *Help* or *Preferences* menu. Some third-parties also provide the ability to refuse their cookies directly by clicking on an opt-out link, and we have indicated where this is possible in the table below.
