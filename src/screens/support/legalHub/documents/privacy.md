## I. Introduction

By using Serch, you trust us with your personal data and we’re committed to keeping that trust. This starts with helping you understand our privacy practices. This policy describes the personal data **(“data”)** we collect, how it’s used and shared, and your choices regarding this data.

We recommend that you read this along with our privacy overview, which highlights key points about our privacy practices.

## II. Overview

### A. SCOPE

This policy applies to users of Serch services anywhere in the world, including users of Serch apps, websites, features, or other services. This policy describes how Serch and its affiliates collect and use data. This policy specifically applies to:

1. Artisans: A general name for persons with skilled abilities to provide handy services.
1. Clients: Individuals who request or receive electrical, mechanical, plumbing and barbing services via their Serch account.
1. Providers: Individuals who provide either electrical, mechanical, plumbing or barbing service to Clients individually or through partner artisan companies.

This policy also governs Serch’s other collections of data in connection with its services. For example, we may collect the data of individuals who start but do not complete their applications to be providers. All those subject to this notice is referred to as “users” in this notice.

Our privacy practices are subject to applicable laws in the places in which we operate. This means that we engage in the practices described in this policy in a particular country or region only if permitted under the laws of those places.
Please contact us [here](/) or through the addresses below with any questions regarding our practices in a particular country or region.

### B. DATA CONTROLLER AND TRANSFER

Serch is the data controller for the data collected in connection with use of Serch’s services everywhere. Serch operates, and processes personal data, globally; wherever and whenever you travel, your data travels with you so we can offer you a seamless experience. We also respect your data protection rights whether you are in your home country or elsewhere.

This means that we may transfer personal data to countries other than your home country in order to provide our services in a different country at your request. We may also transfer personal data to another country if that is necessary to respond to a customer support request that you submitted outside your region. And service histories may be accessed by users in another country after they have left the country where services were rendered.

Because our services involve multiple users at the same time, limited personal data may be accessible to the other user in another country. We do so in order to fulfill our agreements with all of our users, or based on users’ instructions or prior consent, adequacy decisions for the relevant countries, or other transfer mechanisms as may be available under applicable law, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses.

We may also transfer data to other countries in order to respond to a request for personal data from a law enforcement agency. To provide additional safeguards to these data transfers, Serch applies a robust internal procedure for processing these requests. Serch only discloses personal data to law enforcement agencies in a manner that is consistent with the regulatory requirements of applicable laws, such as the GDPR. You can find more information about requests from law enforcement [here](/).

To help provide equivalent data protection wherever you use our services, Serch has implemented the following measures across the globe:

- policies and procedures to limit access to, and the processing of personal data for defined purposes;
- specific training of personnel responsible for managing personal data;
- a government data access policy that refuses government access to data, except when disclosure is mandated by applicable laws including the EU GDPR, there is imminent risk of serious harm to individuals, or consent is obtained;

For your convenience, the exercise of your data protection rights can be directed to Serch and will be handled.

Questions, comments, and complaints about Serch’s data practices can be submitted to the appropriate Serch team [here](/support/hub). You may also use this form to submit a question to Serch’s Data Protection Officer and to ask us for a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses or other transfer mechanisms in place for the data processing activity of your inquiry.

## III. Data Collection and Its Use

### A. DATA WE COLLECT

Serch collects data:

- provided by users to Serch, such as during account creation
- created during use of our services, such as location, app usage, and device data
- from other sources, such as other users or account owners, business partners, vendors, insurance and financial solution providers, and governmental authorities

Serch collects the following data:

1. Data provided by users. This includes:

   - User profile information: We collect data when users create or update their Serch accounts. This may include their name, email, phone number, login name and password, address, profile picture, payment or banking information (including related payment verification information) and other government issued documents (which may include identification numbers as well as birth date, gender, and photo).

   - Background check information (providers): This includes information submitted during the provider person application process, such as provider history or criminal record (where permitted by law), known aliases and prior addresses, and right to work. This information may be collected by an authorized vendor on Serch’s behalf.

   - Identity verification photos: This includes photos of users (such as, selfies) and/or their government issued identifications (such as passports). Such photos may be used to verify a user’s identity, such as through facial verification technologies. Please see the section titled “How we use personal data” for more information regarding how user photos are used for safety and security purposes, including identity verification.

   - Demographic data: We may collect demographic data about users, such as birth date/age, gender or occupation, when required for certain Serch services or programs, such as safety features that allow women users to set a preference to provide or receive services to/from other women (“Women Provider Preference”).

        We may also infer demographic data from other data collected from users. For example, we may infer a user’s gender based on their first name to enable safety features, such as the Women Client Preference, or to display personalized ads for third party products or services. See the section titled “How we use personal data” below for more information.
        We may also collect demographic data through user surveys.

   - User content: We collect the data submitted by users when they contact Serch customer support (including phone chat or video conferencing tools), provide ratings or feedback for other users or otherwise contact Serch. This may include photographs, or audio or video recordings submitted by users in connection with a customer support request. This also includes metadata relating to the method you use to communicate with Serch. The contents of photos and recordings submitted by users are subject to Serch’s Community Guidelines.

2. Data created during use of our services. This includes:

    - Location data (providers): We collect precise or approximate location data from providers’ mobile devices when the Serch app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on-screen).
    - Location data (clients). We collect precise or approximate location information from clients’ mobile devices if they enable us to do so via their device settings. Serch collects such data from the time a client enables the CTG security feature (the CTG is enabled after the provider has accepted and input the providers’ location) until it is turned off by client, and any time the app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen).

    See **“Choice and transparency”** below for information on how clients can enable precise location data collection.

    Clients may use the Serch apps without enabling collection of location data from their mobile devices. However, this may affect certain features in the Serch app. For example, a client who has not enabled precise location data will have to manually enter their service address. In addition, precise location data collected from a provider’s device during a trip is linked to the client’s account, even if the client has not enabled precise location data to be collected from their device. This data is used for purposes such as customer support, fraud detection, insurance, and litigation.
    - Transaction information: We collect transaction information related to the use of our services. We also associate a user’s name with that of anyone who uses their promotion code.
    - Usage data: We collect data about how users interact with our services. This includes access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, browser type, and app crashes and other system activity.
    - Device data: We collect data about the devices used to access our services, including the hardware models, device IP address or other unique device identifiers, operating systems and versions, software, preferred languages, advertising identifiers, device motion data, and mobile network data.
    - Communications data: We collect data regarding phone, text or in-app communications between users that are enabled through Serch’s apps. This includes date and time, as well as the content of text or in-app messages. We may also collect the content of phone calls solely where users are notified in advance that the call may be recorded.

3. Data from other sources. These include:

   - users participating in our referral programs. For example, when a user refers another person, we receive the referred person’s data from that user.
   - Serch account owners who request services for or on behalf of other users (such as friends or family members), or who enable other users to request or receive services through their business accounts (such as Serch for Business accounts).
   - users or others providing information in connection with claims or disputes.
   - Serch business partners through which users create or access their Serch account, or apps or websites that use Serch’s APIs or whose APIs Serch uses.
   - Serch business partners in connection with debit or credit cards issued by a financial institution in partnership with Serch to the extent disclosed in the terms and conditions for the card.
   - vendors who help us verify users’ identity, background information, and eligibility to work, or who screen users in connection with sanctions, anti-money laundering, or know-your-customer requirements.
   - partner artisan companies (for providers who use our services through an account associated with such a company).
   - publicly available sources.
   - marketing service providers or data resellers whose data Serch uses for marketing or research.
   - law enforcement officials, public health officials, and other government authorities.

### B. HOW WE USE PERSONAL DATA

Serch uses data to enable reliable and convenient services. We also use such data:

- to enhance the safety and security of our users and services
- for customer support
- for research and development
- to enable communications between users
- for marketing and advertising
- to send non-marketing communications to users
- in connection with legal proceedings

Serch does not sell or share user data with third parties for purposes of their direct marketing, except with users’ consent.

We use the data we collect:

1. To provide our services. Serch uses data to provide, personalize, maintain, and improve our services. This includes using data to:

   - create/update accounts.
   - enable provision of services, features, such as:
        - using location data to navigate client and provider location, calculate ETAs, and track the provider.
        - features that involve data sharing, such as sharing provider first name and picture with clients to facilitate services, user profile and trip details for ETA sharing, and user ratings and compliments.
        - match available providers to users requesting services. Users can be matched based on availability, location/proximity, user settings/preferences and other factors such as likelihood to accept a request based on their past behavior or preferences. Please see [here](/) for further information about our matching process.
   - process payments.
   - personalize users’ accounts.
   - provide users with service updates, and inform them of changes to our terms, services, or policies.
   - perform necessary operations to maintain our services, including to troubleshoot software bugs and operational problems.

Serch performs the above activities on the grounds that they are necessary to fulfill the terms of our agreements with users, or on the grounds that they are necessary for purposes of Serch’s and its users’ legitimate interests.

1. Safety and security. We use data to help maintain the safety, security, and integrity of our services and users. This includes:
    - verifying users' identity and eligibility to provide chosen service, including through reviews of background checks, to help prevent use of our services by unsafe providers and/or clients.

        In certain regions, this includes Serch’s Real-Time ID Check feature, which prompts providers to share a selfie before going online to help ensure that the provider using the app matches the Serch account we have on file. We may also use this feature for other verification purposes such as regaining account access.

        In addition, we may use facial recognition technology to process user profile photographs, identification photographs, or other user-submitted photographs to prevent identity-borrowing or use of our services by unauthorized providers or delivery people.

    - using provider location information, and communications between clients and providers, to identify transport fees or incentive earned or induced should a client request for provideSharing feature. For example, if a client requests for a mechanic but ends up in need of an electrician, using ProvideShare feature, the client will be charged a small amount or incentive as a pay for the initial provider’s time.
    - using device, location, user profile, usage, and other data to prevent, detect, and combat other types of fraud. This includes identifying fraudulent accounts or uses of our services, preventing use of our services by unauthorized providers, verifying user identities in connection with subscription plans, and preventing and combating unauthorized access to users’ accounts.

        In some cases, such as when a user is determined to be abusing Serch’s referral program or has submitted fraudulent documents, such behavior may result in automatic deactivation, or in the European Union or where otherwise required by law, deactivation after human review. To object to such a deactivation, please contact Serch customer support.
    - using user ratings, reported incidents, and other feedback to encourage compliance with our [Community Guidelines](/legal/document/community-guidelines) and as grounds for deactivating users with low ratings or who otherwise violated such guidelines in certain countries. In the European Union or where otherwise required by law, such deactivation occurs only after human review and/or the possibility to appeal. For more information about how ratings are determined and used, please see here for [client ratings](/), here for [provider ratings](/). To object to such a deactivation, please contact Serch customer support.
    - using provider data (such as location, ratings and gender where legally permitted) and client data (such as ratings, origin and destination) to help avoid pairings of users that may result in increased risk of conflict (for instance, because one user previously gave the other a one-star rating).
    - sharing user name, location, phone number and other relevant information with third-party companies that support the management and de-escalation of interpersonal conflicts that may occur between users while receiving service.

8. With consent Serch may share a user’s data other than as described in this notice if we notify the user and they consent to the sharing.

### E. DATA RETENTION AND DELETION

Serch retains user data for as long as necessary for the purposes described above. Serch retains user data to provide its services and comply with its legal obligations. The period for which we retain user data is determined by the type of data, the category of user to whom the data relates, and the purposes for which we collected the data. The length for which Serch retains user data may further be determined. For example: We retain user data of clients that is processed in order to provide our services, such as the user profile information and credentials, for the lifetime of the user's account.

We retain certain categories of users for a maximum of 7 years regardless of the lifetime of the user's account, such as location data. We retain certain categories of data of all users for a period unrelated to the lifetime of the user's account, to avoid fraudulent use of the app. The period for which the data is retained will be determined by the necessity of the data for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, as well as legal and regulatory requirements. Examples include incomplete provider applications, which are retained for 1 year, and rejected provider which are retained for 7 years.

This generally means that we retain their account and data for 7 years after a deletion request. Users may request deletion of their accounts at any time. Serch may retain user data such as user profile information after a deletion request due to legal or regulatory requirements or for reasons stated in this policy. Users may request deletion of their account at any time through the Settings > Privacy menus in the Serch app, or through Serch’s website (clients here; providers here).

Following an account deletion request, Serch deletes the user’s account and data, unless they must be retained due to legal or regulatory requirements, for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, or because of an issue relating to the user’s account such as an outstanding credit or an unresolved claim or dispute. Because we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements relating to providers and delivery persons, this generally means that we retain their account and data for the applicable statutory retention period after a deletion request. For clients, their data is generally deleted within 90 days of a deletion request, except where retention is necessary for the above reasons.

## IV.Choice and Transparency

Serch enables users to access and/or control data that Serch collects, including through:

- privacy settings
- device permissions

Please check the available settings on your device or check with your provider.

### C. In-app ratings pages

After every service, providers and clients are able to rate each other on a scale from 1 to 5. An average of those ratings is associated with a user’s account and is displayed to other users for whom they provide or receive services. For example, client ratings are available to providers from whom they request service, and provider ratings are available to their clients.

This 2-way system holds everyone accountable for their behavior. Accountability helps create a respectful, safe environment for providers and clients. Users can see their average rating in the MyCentre menu of the Serch app, and also access a breakdown of their average rating in MyCentre>Rating Summary.
